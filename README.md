# Coding test

I created a React project with `npx create-react-app` command.

I installed Apollo and GraphQL with the below command:
`npm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql-tag graphql`

I accessed https://fakerql.stephix.uk/ and made some tests to see how the data looks.

I installed VX for building the histogram:
`npm install --save @visx/mock-data @visx/group @visx/shape @visx/scale @visx/axis`

The reason why I have chosen VX was because the documentation and examples were well written and easy to understand.

I built the histogram with 300 entries from FakerQL.

One of the biggest challenge was that I have never worked with GraphQL, Apollo or VX until now. I had to quickly learn and understand these technologies to be able to complete this project.
